## Running the program
If you would like to test and improve the programs, pull/download the repo and use the command line to run the program:

Ex:

  > cd desktop             //locate directory
  
  > javac CalculatePi.java //compile
  
  > java CalculatePi       //run

Afterwards, you are set to go!
